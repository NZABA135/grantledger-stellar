Milestone-based grant funding using Soroban smart contracts on Stellar.
# GrantLedger

GrantLedger is a transparent grant funding platform
that uses Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar network.

## Problem
Grant funding often lacks transparency and trust.

## Solution
GrantLedger locks grant funds in smart contracts
and releases them only after milestone approval.

## How It Works
1. Donor creates a grant
2. Funds are locked in escrow
3. Milestones are approved by a verifier
4. Funds are released automatically

## Hackathon Scope
This MVP focuses on escrow and milestone logic.

## Tech Stack
- Stellar Network
- Soroban Smart Contracts (Rust)
